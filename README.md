# Weekly Web Dev Challenge - Tip Calculator

This is my entry for Scrimba's Weekly Web Dev Challenge - Tip Calculator, using HTML, CSS and Javascript. By entering the amount of your bill and the tip in % you want to give, it calculates the total you will have to pay.

## Added features:
- Added an input field to enter how many people you were having the meal with
- Based on that, you can calculate the total per person
- Added the option to convert the total from USD to EUR or GBP
- Added an event listener not only to the button, but also to the enter key
- The totals of the currencies you did not choose are hidden / will be hidden again after unchecking the box and press the button or enter key again
